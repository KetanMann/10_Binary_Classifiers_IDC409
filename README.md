# Introduction
The goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a range of machine learning and deep learning models to classify events as either "Signal" or "Noise." This binary classification problem is crucial in domains such as high-energy physics, finance, and anomaly detection, where identifying meaningful events amidst large volumes of background data is essential.<br> 

# Dataset
We used a private dataset from the Belle 2 detector. It had 59 features and 70000 examples. 
## ALGORITHMS USED <br>

1 Logistic Regression from scratch <br>

2 DNN - Simple to complex architectures( total 3) <br>

3 Xgboost - with Feature Importance and leaf visualization of decision tree<br>

4 K-Nearest Neighbours with Dimensionality reduction using PCA<br>

5 Voting Characteristics (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and SVC) <br>

6 Random forest <br>

7 Decision Tree and Dimensionality reduction using PCA(Both 2 and 3 dimensional)<br>

8 SVC and Dimensionality reduction using PCA<br>

9 ELastic Regularised which is basically using both L1 and L2 regularisation with Logistic regression. <br>

10 LDA
